The goal: to decongest cities, and reduce one's carbon footprint, by exploiting all the resources of one's city for mobility üõ¥üå±.\n\n We won with L√©a Buend√© the FREE NOW Challenge during the #Hackathon with our project SmartMOVE. This was made possible thanks to our pitch and a Q&A session that I had the chance to lead üöÄ. In one week we came up with the idea to create an ecosystem that allows users to learn about the impact and costs of a personal car and then redirect them to alternative modes of transportation based on their lifestyle and carbon emissions üåç.",
